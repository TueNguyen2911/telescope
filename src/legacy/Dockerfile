# -------------------------------------

# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is needed by the next.js build, which we define
# as a build ARG in API_URL

# Context: Build Context
FROM node:16 as build

# Set Working Directory Context
WORKDIR "/telescope"

# Copy package.jsons for each service
COPY package.json .

# -------------------------------------
# Context: Dependencies
FROM build AS backend_dependencies

# Install Production Modules!
# Disable postinstall hook in this case since we are being explict with installs
# `postinstall` typically goes on to install front-end and autodeployment modules
# which though is logical for local development, breaks docker container caching trick.
RUN npm install --only=production --no-package-lock --ignore-scripts

# -------------------------------------
# Context: Release
